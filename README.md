## My Process

This project focuses on building an intuitive tip calculator that provides quick and accurate calculations for tip amounts and total costs based on user input. The design is clean and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup:** Utilized semantic elements for improved accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS:** Used custom properties for consistent styling, Flexbox for layout, and responsive design techniques.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented dynamic calculations and interactivity to enhance user engagement.

### Features

- **Bill Input:** Users can enter the total bill amount.
- **Tip Percentage Selection:** Users can choose a predefined tip percentage or enter a custom percentage.
- **Number of People Input:** Users can specify the number of people sharing the bill.
- **Dynamic Calculations:** Automatically calculates the tip amount and total per person as inputs change.
- **Reset Functionality:** Allows users to clear all inputs easily.

### JavaScript Functionality

The project includes a single JavaScript file that handles core functionality. Key components include:

- **Input Handling:** Listens for changes in the bill, tip percentage, and number of people.
- **Dynamic Calculations:** Updates the displayed tip amount and total cost in real-time based on user inputs.
- **Error Handling:** Displays user-friendly messages when inputs are invalid (e.g., no bill amount entered).

### What I Learned

Through this project, I enhanced my skills in:

- **Dynamic Calculations:** Understanding how to perform calculations based on user input.
